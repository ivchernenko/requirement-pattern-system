# Requirement pattern system
This repository contains definitions of basic requirements and extra invariants patterns and a set of lemmas for each pair of patterns, as well as examples of derived patterns defined using the base ones and lemmas for the derived patterns. Derived patterns are numbered, i. e., the name of a derived requirement pattern has name _P_i_, where _i_ is a number. The name of an extra invariant pattern is obtained from the name of the corresponding requirement pattern by adding the postfix "_inv". Patterns are defined in the files [Always.thy](Always.thy), [Constrained_Always](Constrained_Always.thy), [Constrained_Until.thy](Constrained_Until.thy), [Weak_Until.thy](Weak_Until.thy), [Constrained_Weak_Until.thy](Constrained_Weak_Until.thy), [Previous.thy](Previous.thy) and [Since.thy](Since.thy).
